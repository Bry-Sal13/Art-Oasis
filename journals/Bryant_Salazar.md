Today, Monday, May 8th, I met with my group (Bryant, Justin, Zach) for the first time and we went over various website ideas and the degree of difficulty to build.

Tuesday, May 9th, there's been a variety of ideas that we spoke of, including a dating site, a camping site, and a social media site where artists can connect in a professional setting.

Today, May 10th, we chose our site and decided to go with the social media site for professional artists. I believe this is an excellent idea because of my previous passion for the arts and the missing elements of connecting other artists professionally on the web.

On May 11th, Thursday, our group finalized our idea and have been searching and brainstorming for names for the page.

Friday, May 12th, today we started to very vaguely map out how this project could be built and the possible names for it.

Today, Tuesday, May 14th. More mapping and understanding of how and where the project would work together.

On May 15, 2023, we finalized our excalidraw, which includes models and endpoints. Additionally, we delegated specific tasks and sections for each person to complete. Tomorrow is the big day, we will embark on our coding journey for the ArtOasis project.

Tuesday May 16, 2023, I created a branch for my post backend section

It's Wednesday, May 17 I'm having some trouble with figuring out how to best do my backend portion

Thursday, May 18th After lots of videos about FastAPI and following Curtis' videos, I got a good idea of how to set up my backend work.

Today is Friday, May 19th. I continued working on the backend. Nothing significant happened this day.

Monday, May 22nd I am still working on the backend.

Today is Tuesday, May 23rd putting the finishing touches on the backend. I've been reviewing material and conversing with teammates.

May 24th (Wednesday). I finished the backend.

Thursday, May 25th, I started watching videos on how to properly setup a react frontend and started outlining my plans for my portion of the frontend page.

Friday, May 26th, today I started my main page.

Monday, May 29th, I looked at a few bootstrap that I may want to use.

On Tuesday, May 30th, Zach and I started livesharing the mainpage and working on it together.

Wednesday, May 31st, Today the group and I decided I should start working on deployment since we heard that it doesn't work on windows very well, and since Shane's iMac has issues, they decided I should be the one to do it.

Thursday, June 1st Today I handed the mainpage off to Zach and started working on deployment

Friday, June 2nd, Deployment has been tough and I've been having lots of issues with it.

Monday, June 5th, I finally managed to get part of deployment going but we can't get the api services deployed. I decided to move onto frontend deployment instead.

Tuesday, June 6th, I got frontend deployment working and am continuing to hack at the backend with Rosheen.

Wednesday, June 7th, Backend deployment is still giving us lots of issues. Rosheen and James advised us to look into merging into a single database.

Thursday, June 8th, We merged all our migrations into a single file and made it so there was only one database instead of two. I got my unit test done, and with Justin's help figured out how to format the json data in the correct way so the times match up.

Friday, June 9th, I am trying to finish deploying now with a single database. After about two hours of trial and error, I got deployment officially working and the entire website is now working. Thank god. Now I just have to wait for the grading.
